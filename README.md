# air's kubejs changes! all in one spot!
- removed hardrock's texture replacements for existing things like diamonds, lapis, emeralds, redstone and wrought iron! this includes GUIs and also includes the smooth font! all of these are moved to a [resource pack](https://github.com/airsh4de/htfc3-kubejs_patches/blob/main/hardrock's%20texture%20overrides.zip)
- fixed some textures from the tfc ore washing mod having random accidental pixels
- added mekanism pigment extraction recipes for tfc sandstone
- added two extra recipes for tannin
- added a create mixer recipe for lye
- made petcoke useable in coke coal recipes
- changed the millstone recipe to require placing raw stone on a gearstone and not the other way around
- added extra recipes for olive paste, seed paste and tree seed paste
- tweaked tiny coal and tiny charcoal's burn temperatures and burn durations
- removed drying mat recipe and made solar dryers cheaper
- added an automated recipe for fire bricks
- made PNC crude oil processable in the distillation tower, as opposed to it being completely useless
- custom item and fluid names are more consistent
- mineral samples are now breakable again (and are also much less tough)
- added tags and updated tooltips for pollution filter items
- removed itemfilters from JEI as I'm pretty sure those are only used in making quests and don't have a functional use
- made burlap cloth cost more when made directly from industrial hemp
- removed coral powder to mortar recipe because why was it even a thing ;-;
