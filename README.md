# air's kubejs changes! all in one spot!
- removed hardrock's texture replacements for existing things like diamonds, lapis, emeralds, redstone and wrought iron! this includes GUIs and also includes the smooth font! all of these are moved to a [resource pack](https://github.com/airsh4de/htfc3-kubejs_patches/blob/main/hardrock's%20texture%20overrides.zip)
- fixed some textures from the tfc ore washing mod having random accidental pixels
- added mekanism pigment extraction recipes for tfc sandstone
- added extra recipes for tannin, lye, fire bricks, tree seed and olive paste, oil and oil water
- made petcoke useable in coke coal recipes
- changed the millstone recipe to require placing raw stone on a gearstone and not the other way around
- tweaked burn temperatures and durations for tiny coal and tiny charcoal
- removed drying mat recipe and made solar dryers cheaper, as drying mats are very tps heavy
- made PNC crude oil processable in the distillation tower, as opposed to it being completely useless
- custom kubejs item and fluid names are now more consistent
- mineral samples are now breakable again (and are also much less tough)
- pollution filter items now have item tags as well as updated descriptions
- itemfilters's filter items are now hidden in JEI
- made burlap cloth cost more when made directly from industrial hemp
- removed coral powder to mortar recipe as coral powder now has a better use as a filter
