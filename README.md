# Rough changelogs / differences from 1.4.9
- removed hardrock's texture replacements for existing things like diamonds, lapis, emeralds, redstone and wrought iron! this includes GUIs and also includes the smooth font! all of these are moved to a [resource pack](https://github.com/airsh4de/htfc3-kubejs_patches/blob/main/hardrock's%20texture%20overrides.zip)
- fixed some textures from the tfc ore washing mod having random accidental pixels
- custom kubejs item and fluid names are now more consistent
- pollution filter items now have item tags as well as updated descriptions
- mineral samples are now breakable again (and are also much less tough)
- molten andesite and molten andesite alloy now have proper names instead of showing ID

- added extra recipes for tannin, lye, fire bricks, tree seed and olive paste, oil and oil water
